The Sparrow Boarding 001 was a coordinated assault lead by [[Ephraim]] with the goal of forcing the [[Sparrow]] to turn back to Sol or destroy it.

# Timeframe
Boarding 001 occurred in January 2729 (Sessions 16 and 17) over the course of a single day.

# Background
In mid to late January, the Sparrow picked up on a signal matching the signature of a wormhole three million kilometers off our stern. Through it, a [[Cogitatio vermis|Thoughtworm]] infector ship appeared. Over a few days, it evaded multiple long range attacks and traps from the Sparrow. 

Once within range, the full assault began with another wormhole opening (~2km in size) and the [[Dvinalya]] moved through it, aiming at the Sparrow. During the battle with the Dvinalya, the infector ship teleported above the Sparrow and began deploying multiple boarding pods, many of which made it and attached to the Sparrow. Shortly after, another wormhole opens and through it a needlepoint ship appears; it rips through the infector vessel and embedding itself into the sparrow.

The boarding party consisted of two powerful psychics - a man named **Eser** and a woman named **Pyralia** along with hundreds of corrupted Dvinalya Marines.

# Aftermath
The Sparrow suffered damage to multiple locations including:
- A completely burned primary bridge
- A crashed [[Ye-Tai]] needleship on the port side near the primary bridge

## Losses
250 crewmembers were killed. 150 were key crew and 100 were auxiliary Marines

**Remaining key crew:** 750
**Remaining auxiliary contingents:** 1,900
**Remaining bulk cargo:** 30,000 (no loss)
