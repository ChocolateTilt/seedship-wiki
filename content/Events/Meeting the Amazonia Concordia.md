A meeting turned coup between the [[Sparrow]] and the [[Amazonia Concordia]]. Command staff of the Sparrow met with the team of CEOs leading the Amazonia - [[Charis Kobayashi]], [[Vasily Peshkov]], and [[Chiwetei Babangida]]. 

# Timeframe
Awake cycle, 2749

# Background
Early on the Sparrow's journey, the crew - after detecting the Amazonia and determining it is likely dead - decided to approach the vessel and board it to salvage any useful machinery and supplies.  

## Message from the Amazonia to the Sparrow
*Hello, my name is Charis Kobayashi. I am one of three remaining Executives aboard Amazonia Concordia.* 

*We understand you intend to rendezvous with our vessel, under the belief that its human crew are dead. We are happy to inform you we are not dead, in fact, we are doing quite well. Amazonia Concordia has suffered no major mechanical issues, and we remain hopeful for our arrival in Epsilon Eridani in 1400 years.* 

*We wish to be transparent. Our "death" was a carefully fabricated scheme to ensure everyone back home would believe this mission failed. We are, after all, competitive people by nature. It was deemed best for the long-term success of our investment if Sol remained ignorant of us and believed similar projects were still technologically unfeasible.* 

*It is clear, however, that circumstances have changed. We received worrying radio traffic from Earth, around the time of your departure from the system. It became apparent to us that some calamity, the Defilement as later reports called it, had utterly annihilated the E.P.U. and put humanity on the back foot.* 

*Later, when we observed the speck of light that was Sparrow as you transited into interstellar space, we began to understand better. That immense fusion torch drive, the science and survey equipment bristling about your hull; you are fleeing, aren't you? Things have truly fallen apart, for no one would commit such wealth to a ship such as yours unless it was necessary.* 

*We invite you to rendezvous with us, and join us for a discussion on what has befallen humanity, and what we may do now. We are open to exchanging knowledge, technology, and resources if necessary. Truthfully, I hope you and I may at least share a meal before passing on into the black.*
