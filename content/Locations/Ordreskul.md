*Ordreskul* is an ocean planet littered with archipelagos and super-volcano networks. It has been identified as a time anomaly by [[Milton]] and appears to come from a future where an alliance between the [[Ye-Tai]] and [[Humans|Humanity]] is a historic event.

The planet is protected by a psychically enhanced nanobot network called an "Angelnet" (originally of Ye-Tai design) that can control the planet's weather, monitor the planet, and act as an early warning system / deterrent.
