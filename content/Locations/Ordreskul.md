# General Information
**Population:** Unknown

**Other Names:** Qara Göl ([[Serf|Venusian Engineered Humans]])

*Ordreskul* is an ocean planet littered with archipelagos and super-volcano networks. It has been identified as a time anomaly by [[Milton]] and appears to come from a future where an alliance between the [[Ye-Tai]] and [[Humans|Humanity]] is a historic event.

The planet is protected by a psychically enhanced nanobot network called an "Angelnet" (originally of Ye-Tai design) that can control the planet's weather, monitor the planet, and act as an early warning system / deterrent.

# Points of Interest
## The Light Station
The Light Station is a small outpost on an island within a volcanic archipelago. The lighthouse itself contains a C2 bunker that has the capability of contacting Mars, among several other planets in and out of Sol.

# Notable Events
A landing party from the [[Amazonia Concordia]] lead a failed expedition to the planet ([[Qara Göl Expedition Logs]]).

A landing party from the [[Sparrow]] started an expedition to the planet on May 11th, 2734 ([[Ordreskul Recovery Operation]])
