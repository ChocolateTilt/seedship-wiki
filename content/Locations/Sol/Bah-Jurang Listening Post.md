## Recording dated Sept 30, 2564
DIRECTOR EPHRAIM: **incoherent** “no way of knowing its origin off visual alone. Do a full spectrum scan, but keep us quiet.”

SILVANUS: “Yes sir.”

A series of electronic hums and beeps occur for several minutes, murmured conversation.

SILVANUS: “Radar-absorbent coating of some kind, I can’t resolve acc-” **incoherent**

A series of staticky “pops”, some kind of audio interference

ZHUANG: “I’ve got it pinned on electro-optical, spiral shaped object 2 meters across with a trailing tail, total length approximately 10 meters. Kind of tapers off at the tail. Bizarre.”

EPHRAIM: “I can’t find a match in any database. Not one of ours, or Martian. Throw a probe at it.”

SILVANUS: “Dispatching.. probe on approach. I’m bringing up its feeds..”

ZHUANG: “Christ that’s a weird ship. Is that spiral at the front a radiator?”

EPHRAIM: “No.”

ZHUANG: “There are experimental droplet-radiators that might spiral around the ship like that.. didn’t think anyone tried it y-”

Footsteps can be heard in the Listening Post, presumably Director Ephraim moving across the room to the primary comms panel.

SILVANUS: “Unknown craft is changing orientation, swinging around on a bearing for the LP. It’s accelerating, 1, sorry, now 3gs acceleration.”

EPHRAIM: “I’m hitting the panic switch, get the marines up and ready. Silvanus, can you get the EW suite running?”

A series of switches can be heard being flicked, followed by a low-level hum throughout the LP.

SILVANUS: “Jamming active, unknown vessel still on-” **incoherent** **incoherent** *incoherent**

The audio peaks out to an ear-splitting shriek, inhuman, before resolving down into the screams of several people in apparent agony. Beneath the human screams and the thumps of fists against metal floors, is a deeper tone that acts on the mind like a hydraulic press. It breaks into the minds of the Listening Post staff, cracking a hole in their consciousnesses and sucking the innards out. The knowledge of an entity whose existence is unknowable to a human mind pours in after, and leaves them intact enough to fulfill its tasks.
