# General Information


# Government
Martian government is idealistic and "good"
- Does not see much of a distinction between military and civilian life, so the government is basically the military but its a meritocracy that works (with notable exceptions mostly in the war against Venus)
- Earth's government was modeled after Mars', losing them is like losing a sibling
