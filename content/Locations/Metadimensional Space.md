# General Information
**Population:** Unknown

**Other Names:** Oversea ([[Ye-Tai]]), The Sticks (Martians)

**Metadimensional Space** (MDS) is an extra-dimensional layer of current known space and the likely source of [[Metadimensional Energy]].

# Known properties
- Inaccessible to ordinary matter
- Time and space are not fixed quantities, but subject to change at the expense of energy
- It is extremely unstable and chaotic; an otherwise stable field will collapse with no obvious cause only to reintegrate later

## Travel
MDS can be travelled through, both physically and via dreams. Its effects on a person appear to vary greatly depending on your species and method.

**Humans**
Humans who physically travel through MDS experience psychosis and are corrupted, allowing them to be easily controlled by the [[Cogitatio vermis]] without direct infection. 
- Additional research is needed in order to determine if Humans are able to recover from the the corruption and prevent it from happening in the first place. 

Humans who travel to MDS via dreams do not appear to be directly corrupted.

**Ye-Tai**
Ye-Tai appear to be unaffected by travel through MDS. Their Motherships are able to send forces through via unknown technology for incredibly quick travel.

# Species
[[Cogitatio vermis]] likely originated somewhere within MDS, its exact home-world coordinates are unknown.
