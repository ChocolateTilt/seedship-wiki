# General Information
**Population:** Unknown

**Other Names:** Oversea (Ye-Tai), The Sticks (Martians)

---
**Metadimensional Space** (MDS) is a dimensional layer of current known space. 

## Known properties
- Inaccessible to ordinary matter
- Time and space are not fixed quantities, but subject to change at the expense of energy
- It is extremely unstable and chaotic; an otherwise stable field will collapse with no obvious cause only to reintegrate later

## Travel
MDS can be travelled through, both physically and via dreams. Its effects on a person appear to vary greatly depending on your species and method.
### Humans
Humans who physically travel through MDS experience psychosis and are corrupted, allowing them to be easily controlled by the [[Cogitatio vermis|Thoughtworm]] without direct infection. 
- Additional research is needed in order to determine if Humans are able to recover from the the corruption and prevent it from happening in the first place. 

Humans who travel to MDS via dreams do not appear to be directly corrupted.

### [[Ye-Tai]]
Ye-Tai appear to be unaffected by travel through MDS. Their Motherships are able to send forces through via unknown technology for incredibly quick travel.

# Points of Interest

# Species
[[Cogitatio vermis]] likely originated somewhere within MDS, its exact home-world coordinates are unknown.

# Metadimensional Energy
Discovered by [[quartz/content/People/Hippocrates Reardon|Hippocrates Reardon]], **Metadimensional Energy** (MDE) is a radiation or wave phenomenon that appears to be sourced from MDS. This energy can be harnessed and used to communicate over vast distances and utilize psychic abilities. MDE can also manifest in music or ritualistic prayer according to [[Sandile Vincent|Dr. Vincent]]

Dr. Reardon was able to discover a way to shield against background and slightly elevated forms of MDE however current technology appears to be ineffective against the presence of more powerful wielders.
