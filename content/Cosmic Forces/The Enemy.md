*The Enemy* is a genocidal alien threat of unknown origins that appear to be able to manipulate the minds of creatures through the use of Metadimensional Energy. 

# Lifecycle
Not much is known about the lifecycle of The Enemy. Due to the fact that entities like [[Ephraim]] have titles, it appears that they are able to persist after infecting a creature.

# Society
Little is known about how the C. vermis organizes itself, though it seems that sheer power is what is respected within their ranks.
