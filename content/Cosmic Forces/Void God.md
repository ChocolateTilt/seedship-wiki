# General Information
**Description:** A massive entity with a long narrow face, its eyes are two white glowing holes.

---
The **Void God** was an extremely old creature of unimaginable strength from [[Metadimensional Space|The Sticks]]. It imprinted on Humanity after [[Benjamin (Ben) Elias|Elias]]'s first dream-walk into Metadimensional Space. The entity lent its strength to Humanity for a price; A type of parasite in its own right, the Void God fed off of Humanity's ideals growing in power as more fell to its worship.

It was killed during the [[Void God Attack on The Sparrow]] by [[Milton]] who was able to overpower and ultimately destroy the entity before it was able to do unimaginable damage to the Sparrow and her crew.
