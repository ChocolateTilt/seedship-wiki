# About
Private Military Company with a longstanding history of brutal strike-breaking and reprisals against labor movements within Venusian territory. 

The solar system remnant of this company was eventually annihilated after mistakenly picking the wrong side of a coup attempt against the Pryme. Their home asteroid base has been a small dust cloud for a century now.
