Originally named VNS Surpico, the *Bhagavad Gita* was an extremely advanced warship piloted solely by Artificial Intelligence created by [[Venus]] in 2485. During its maiden voyage it destroyed its Venusian military escort and burned quickly out of the solar system heading toward Betelgeuse, renaming and reconfiguring itself as it went.
